# Memory Management Simulation - Main Program

## Overview
This program integrates all the memory management techniques into one application. It demonstrates:
- Memory Pooling
- Fixed-size Memory Block Allocation
- Reference Counting
- Multi-threaded Memory Allocation

## Code Explanation
- Each of the classes (`MemoryPool`, `MemoryBlockAllocator`, `RefCountedMemory`, `MemorySimulatorParallel`) is demonstrated one after the other in the `main()` function.
- It shows the practical use of these memory management techniques in a simple, interactive way.

## Features
- Combines multiple memory management techniques.
- Simple, easy-to-understand simulation of how each technique works.
- Demonstrates the effects of each technique in memory allocation and deallocation.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Observe how each memory management technique is applied.
3. Use the memory management techniques as needed for different scenarios in real-world applications.
